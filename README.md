# Microservice Template with Flask and JWT Auth
A handy template to get started with MyRadio authentcation with JSON Web Tokens and Flask. This can be rapidly deployed on URY's microservices infrastructure via portainer.

# Setup

You can setup this up in docker, but if you want to develop it might be easier to be closer to the metal and run on your machine. Simply install the pyton env and run the the main file. Make sure to fill out the an appropriate env file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The server will be live on `127.0.0.1:6339` - check, the port may be different.
